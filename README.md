# Snake-Game
Created it just for fun while working with javascript canvas. Very simple and basic game. Pretty much everyone has played it at least once in their life. In this game, the player maneuvers a line which grows in length as snake hits points(food), with the line itself being a primary obstacle. The player loses when the snake runs into the screen border or itself.
